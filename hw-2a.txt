Week 2 of "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"

Quesition 1
What typically calls an event handler?


- Some code that you didn't write which generates the event.

Question 2
In CodeSkulptor, how many event handlers can be running at the same time?
- 1

Question 3
What are the three parts of a frame?
Refer to the video on SimpleGUI.
- Canvas
- Status Area
- Control Area

Question 4
For the SimpleGUI-based programs in this course, we recommended breaking down an interactive Python program into seven parts.  Below, these parts are listed alphabetically.

1 Create frame
2 Define classes
3 Define event handlers
4 Initialize global variables
5 Define helper functions
6 Register event handlers
7 Start frame and timers
However, in lecture, we recommended a particular ordering of these parts.
- 4 5 2 3 1 6 7

Question 5
Assume the following global definition is part of your program.
x = 5

If each of the following function definitions are also part of your program, which of them needs a global x declaration? 
-
def a(y):
    x = x + y
    return y

Question 6
Consider the following code.

count = 0

def square(x):
    global count
    count += 1
    return x**2

print square(square(square(square(3))))

What is the value of count at the end?  Enter a number. 
- 4

Question 7
Consider the following code. 

a = 3
b = 6

def f(a):
    c = a + b
    return c
    
- f
- a
- b

Question 8
Consider the following code.

a = 3
b = 6

def f(a):
    c = a + b
    return c
    
- a
- c

Question 9
Which of the following are valid calls to create_frame?
- f = simplegui.create_frame("My Frame", 100, 100)
- frame = simplegui.create_frame("Testing", 200, 200, 300)

Question 10
If the following is our entire program, what one line of code should replace the question marks for it to show a frame? 

???
f = simplegui.create_frame("My frame", 200, 200)
f.start()

- import simplegui
