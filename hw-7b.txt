Week 7 of "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"

Question 1
The class code provided for this week's mini-project supports an ImageInfo class to organize the data associated with the image. 
Consider an ImageInfo object of the following form:

ImageInfo([45, 45], [90, 90], 35)

What is the radius of the shape associated with this ImageInfo object?
- 35, This is the radius of the circle used in computing collisions involving the shape.

Question 2
Consider the provided ImageInfo and Sprite class code.  Assume we want ten asteroids on the screen, each looking exactly alike and using the same image file. 
How many ImageInfo objects and how many Sprite objects should we create?

- one ImageInfo object, ten Sprite objects
  Since there is one image file, there should be one ImageInfo. 
  Since there are ten displayed asteroids, each potentially with its own velocity and angle, there should be ten Sprite objects.
  
Question 3
The version of Rice Rocks that we will implement uses only a single asteroid image and spawns multiple instances of the provided Sprite class using this image.  
In the original Asteroids, a large asteroid split into two medium asteroids which themselves split into two small asteroids.

- Add a size attribute in the Sprite class and a size parameter to Sprite.__init__.  Use the size attribute when drawing the sprite.

  Adding a size attribute in the Sprite class allows each instance of a sprite to have a different size that can use in the draw method for the sprite.
  
Question 4
What is the supported range of sound volumes in set_volume?
- 0 to 1

Question 5
Assume you have code that loads and plays a sound.  Unfortunately, you don't hear anything.  Which of the following could be a reason?
- The given URL exists, but is inaccessible due to network problems.
- A file found with the given URL isn't a sound file recognized by your browser.
- Your browser is loading a big sound file.  Wait longer.
- You have set the volume level to 0.
- No file is found with the given URL.

Question 6
Which of the following are valid HTML representations of the color blue?
- "rbg(0, 0, 255)"
- "#0000FF"
- "blue"

Question 7
Imagine we are writing code for something like Rice Rocks, where things are moving in 2D toroidal space, i.e., the wrap around all four sides of the screen. 
How can we eliminate the duplicated code in the following function?

-
NUM_DIMENSIONS = 2
def move(position, vector):
    """Moves the position by the given vector in 2D toroidal space."""
    for d in range(NUM_DIMENSIONS):
        position[d] = (position[d] + vector[d]) % SCREEN_SIZE[d]
        
-
def move_dimension(dimension, position, vector):
    """Moves the position component by the given vector component in 1D toroidal space."""
    position[dimension] = (position[dimension] + vector[dimension]) % SCREEN_SIZE[dimension]

def move(position, vector):
    """Moves the position by the given vector in 2D toroidal space."""
    move_dimension(0, position, vector)
    move_dimension(1, position, vector)
    
Question 8
What is the primary reason for not duplicating code?
- You only need to get the code correct once.

Question 9
What is Mike Massimino's greatest accomplishment?
- Being the first person to use Twitter in space
