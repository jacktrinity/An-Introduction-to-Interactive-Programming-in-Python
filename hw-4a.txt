Question 1
Python has a built-in function that adds up the numbers in a list. For example, given the list [1, 2, 5, 4], this function returns 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12. 
Use your search skills to find the name of this built-in function. 
Enter the name of the built-in function below, without any parentheses or arguments.
- sum

Question 2
Let my_list be the list ["This", "course", "is", "great"]

What is len(my_list)?
What non-negative number is the index on "great"
i.e., how would you replace the question marks in mw_list[???] so that the resulting value is "great"?

Submit two numbers, one for each of these two questions, separated by spaces.
- 4 3

Question 3
Let my_list be the list ["This", "course", "is", "great"]

We can use Python's slice notation to get part of this list.
What non-negative numbers can be used to the slice ["course", "is"]
i.e., what non negative numbers should we put in my_list[??? : ???] to the result?

Submit two numbers, one for each of these two questions, separated by spaces.
