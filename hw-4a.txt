Question 1
Python has a built-in function that adds up the numbers in a list. For example, given the list [1, 2, 5, 4], this function returns 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 12. 
Use your search skills to find the name of this built-in function. 
Enter the name of the built-in function below, without any parentheses or arguments.
- sum

Question 2
Let my_list be the list ["This", "course", "is", "great"]

What is len(my_list)?
What non-negative number is the index on "great"
i.e., how would you replace the question marks in mw_list[???] so that the resulting value is "great"?

Submit two numbers, one for each of these two questions, separated by spaces.
- 4 3

Question 3
Let my_list be the list ["This", "course", "is", "great"]

We can use Python's slice notation to get part of this list.
What non-negative numbers can be used to the slice ["course", "is"]
i.e., what non negative numbers should we put in my_list[??? : ???] to the result?

Submit two numbers, one for each of these two questions, separated by spaces.
- 1 3

Question 4
If we want to split a list my_list into two halves, which of the following uses slices to do so correctly?

More precisely, if the length of my_list is 2n, i.e., even, then the two parts should each have length n. 
If its length is 2n+1, i.e., odd, then the two parts should have lengths n and n+1.
- my_list[0 : len(my_list) // 2] and my_list[len(my_list) // 2 : len(my_list)]
- my_list[0 : len(my_list) // 2] and my_list[len(my_list) // 2 :]

Question 5
What is the distance between point [4, 7] and the nearest point on the circle centered at [2, 9] with radius 2? 
Provide at least 4 digits of accuracy.
- 0.82842

Question 6
A ball with velocity [4, 2] reflects off a vertical wall.  
What is its new velocity?
- [-4, 2]

Question 7
Which of the following illustrate how to properly structure a keydown or keyup event handler? 
-
def keydown_handler(key):
    if "left" == KEY_MAP[key]:
        …
        
Question 8
Assume you have a program with a keydown handler. You run it, and press a single key and hold it down continuously.  H
ow many times does the keydown handler get called?
- 1

Question 9
Several keys on the keyboard, such as Shift, CapsLock, and Ctrl, typically act to modify what happens when you press other keys, rather than doing anything on their own.  
When using the SimpleGUI keydown handler, how are such keys treated?
- Independent key press events — e.g., pressing Shift by itself creates an event
