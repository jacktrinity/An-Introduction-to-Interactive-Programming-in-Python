Question 1
What Python operator takes two strings (e.g., "sun" and "rise") and forms the combination of these two strings, one followed by the other (e.g., "sunrise")?
- +

Question 2
What does the draw handler parameter represent?
- The canvas

Question 3
What happens if you draw text outside the canvas coordinates?
- Some or none of the text is shown. Conceptually, the text is drawn at whatever coordinates are given, but only whatever text fits within the canvas coordinates is shown.

Question 4
Assume we have a canvas that is 200 pixels wide and 300 pixels high.  
We want to draw a green line between the upper left corner of the canvas and the lower right corner of the canvas.  Which of the following calls will accomplish this?

- canvas.draw_line((0, 0), (200, 300), 10, "Green")

Question 5
Conside the following function definition.

def date(month, day):
    """Given numbers month and day, returns a string of the form '2/12',
    with the month followed by the day."""
    return month + "/" + day

print date(2, 12)

This definition leads to an error.  To fix it, what Python expression should replace the question marks below?

def date(month, day):
    """Given numbers month and day, returns a string of the form '2/12',
    with the month followed by the day."""
    return ???

print date(2, 12)

- str(month) + "/" + str(day)

Question 6
Assume we have a variable word that contains a string, such as "Mississippi" or "indivisible". We would like to determine how many "i"'s are in the string word. 
What code should replace the question marks in the following function definition?
- word.count("i")

Question 7
Where should your draw_text, draw_line, and similar drawing calls be?
- In a draw handler, or a helper function called from it

Question 8
Which of the following function calls are valid, i.e., don't lead to an error?
- float("5")
- float("5.4")

Question 9
Turn the following description into a CodeSkulptor program, and run it.

1. Create a 300-by-300 canvas.
2. Draw two circles with radius 20 and white lines of width 10.  One is centered at (90,200) and one at (210,200).
3. Draw a red line of width 40 from (50,180) to (250,180).
4. Draw two red lines of width 5 from (55,170) to (90,120) and from (90,120) to (130,120).
5. Draw a red line of width 140 from (180,108) to (180,160).

The resulting picture is a simple diagram of what?
- An automobile

Question 10
The following is a diagram of an archery target.
- .
Question 10
The following is a diagram of an archery target.

To draw this in CodeSkulptor, we can put a small yellow circle with a black border on top of a slightly bigger yellow circle with a black border, â€¦ 
on top of a big white circle with a black border. In what order should your code draw these circles?
- Largest first
Whatever is drawn first will last appears to be on top.
