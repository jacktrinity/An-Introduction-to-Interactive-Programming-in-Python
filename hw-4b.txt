Week 4 of "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"

Question 1
Python, [1, 2, 3] is the type list. What is the name of the type (1, 2, 3)?
- Tuple

Question 2
Which of the following types of data are immutable in python?
- Booleans
- Tuples
- String
- Numbers

Question 3
Which of the following functions must include a global point declaration in order to change the global variable point?

point = [0, 0]

def function1():
    point[0] += 1
    point[1] += 2

def function2():
    point = [50, 50]
    
- function2

Question 4
Consider the following program.

a = [49, 27, 101, -10]
b = a
c = list(a)
d = c

a[3] = 68
c[2] = a[1]
b = a[1 : 3]
b[1] = c[2]

What are the elements of the list in variable b? 
- 27 27

Question 5
In our program, the variable position represents a 2D position on the canvas. We want to be able to change the position by some amount in variable delta. 
Why is the following code snippet incorrect?

position = [50, 50]
delta = [1, -2]
…
position = position + delta

- The + operator on lists does not mean addition of the numbers in a list.

Question 6
Consider the following program.

a = ["green", "blue", "white", "black"]
b = a
c = list(a)
d = c

a[3] = "red"
c[2] = a[1]
b = a[1 : 3]
b[1] = c[2]

At the end of this code, to how many list objects do the variables refer?

- 3

Question 7
Convert the following specification into code. Do the point and rectangle ever overlap?

A point starts at [10, 20]. It repeatedly changes position by [3, 0.7] — e.g., under button or timer control. 
Meanwhile, a rectangle stays in place. Its corners are at [50, 50] (upper left), [180, 50] (upper right), [180, 140] (lower right), and [50, 140] (lower left).

- Yes

Question 8
Assume we are using acceleration control for a spaceship in a game.  That is, we regularly have the following updates:

1. The position is incremented by the time interval multiplied by the velocity.  This happens on each draw event.
2. The velocity is incremented by the time interval multiplied by the acceleration.  This happens on each draw event.
3. The acceleration is periodically incremented by some fixed vector (the same vector for each step).  This could happen on keyboard or timer events.

Assume that, initially, the ship is stationary and subject to no acceleration. What sort of trajectory will the spaceship fly in?
- A stright line

Question 9 
Write a Python program that initializes a global variable to 5. The keydown event handler updates this global variable by doubling it, 
while the keyup event handler updates it by decrementing it by 3.

What is the value of the global variable after 12 separate key presses, i.e., pressing and releasing one key at a time, and repeating this 12 times in total?
- 8195
