Question 1

class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def translate(self, deltax = 0, deltay = 0):
        """Translate the point in the x direction by deltax 
           and in the y direction by deltay."""
        self.x += deltax
        self.y += deltay

    …
    
Which of the following code snippets are valid usages of the Point2D initializer and its translate method?    

-
point1 = Point2D(3, 9)
point2 = Point2D()
point2.translate(20, 4)

-
point = Point2D(3, 9)
point.translate(5, -2)

Question 2

class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def translate(self, deltax=0, deltay=0):
        """Translate the point in the x direction by deltax
           and in the y direction by deltay."""
        self.x += deltax
        self.y += deltay

    …
    
Which of the following code snippets are valid usages of the Point2D initializer and its translate method?

-
points = [Point2D(2, 5), Point2D(8, 3), Point2D(0, 2)]
for point in points:
    point.translate(-1, -1)
    
Question 3

class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def translate(self, deltax=0, deltay=0):
        """Translate the point in the x direction by deltas 
           and in the y direction by deltay."""
        self.x += deltax
        self.y += deltay

    def __str__(self):
        return "<" + str(self.x) + ", " + str(self.y) + ">"
        
For the Point2D class above, having only the three methods shown, which of the following code snippets are valid usages of the Point2D class?      

-
point = Point2D(3, 6)
s = str(point)

Question 4
In SimpleGUI, the function draw_image takes an optional sixth parameter that determines the angle of rotation of the destination rectangle around its center. 
Do positive values for the angle rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise? Is the angle specified in degrees or radians?
- clockwise, radians

Question 5
One interesting extension of Rice Rocks would be to have two ships, with each controlled by a separate player, instead of one single ship.  
Using the provided class definitions, what is the best way to represent the two ships in this new variant?
- Add another call to the Ship constructor, assigning the result to another global variable.
ship1 = Ship(…)
ship2 = Ship(…)

Question 6
Which of the following browsers fully support MP3 audio files?
- Chrome
- Safari

Question 7
Consider a spaceship where the ship's thrusters can accelerate the ship by 10 pixels per second for each second that the thrust key is held down.  
If the friction induces a deceleration that is 10% of the ship's velocity per second, what is the maximal velocity of the ship?  If you are having trouble, 
consider writing a short program to help understand this problem.
- Around 100 pixels per second
  At a velocity of 100 pixels per second, friction would induce a deceleration of 10 pixels per second.  
  This deceleration would exactly cancel an acceleration of 10 pixels per second from the thrusters.  
  We used “around” here since the true maximal velocity depends on the rate at which the frame is drawn.
